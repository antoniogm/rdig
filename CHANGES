0.2.2
- PDF title extraction with pdfinfo
- removed dependency on mkmf which doesn't seem to exist in Ruby 1.8.2
- made content extractors more flexible - instances now use a given 
  configuration instead of the global one. This allows the 
  WordContentExtractor to use an HtmlContentExtractor with it's own 
  configuration that is independent of the global config.
